# Knitting renderer

Given a knitting pattern given as a list of lists (rows of stitches), 
generate a svg file that represents schematically the pattern in question. 

# Usage

Write the pattern description to the `model1` variable in `main.py`. Execute `python3 main.py`.

There will be execution errors if your pattern is not sound (i.e., if there are too many/too few stiches on a row).
